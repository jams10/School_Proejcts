## Tips
(Should move Programming_Tips repo)

1. [Strcmp return value](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13571907/when-will-strcmp-not-return-1-0-or-1)
   In bst.c file strcmp function returned '-7', not -1.
   
2. Segment fault by stackoverflow in Linux 
   
   Should decrease size of arrays or allocate arrays dynamically.

3. [CPU의 코어 쓰레드와 소프트웨어에서의 쓰레드](https://kldp.org/node/154708)
