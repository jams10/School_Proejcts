-US mulls retaliation to French tech tax-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The US is preparing tariffs on $2.4bn (Â£1.85bn) worth of French exports as retaliation against the country's new digital services tax.

The top US trade official said the new tax, which France approved in July, unfairly targets American tech giants.

He said the potential tariffs were intended to deter other countries from taking similar steps.

The items that could face tariffs at rates up to 100% include cheese, sparkling wine, make-up and handbags.

The decision "sends a clear signal that the United States will take action against digital tax regimes that 
discriminate or otherwise impose undue burdens on US companies", said US Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer.
