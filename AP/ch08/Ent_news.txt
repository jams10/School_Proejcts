The US actors' union is investigating the departure of America's Got Talent judge Gabrielle Union following reports that 
she voiced concerns about a "toxic" culture on the show.

Variety magazine said the LA's Finest star had raised concerns with producers and was leaving after just one series.

Sag-Aftra, which represents actors and performers, is looking into the case.

NBC, which makes the show, said it was "committed to ensuring a respectful workplace for all employees".

-Shelley Morrison: Tributes after Will & Grace actress dies aged 83-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Actress Shelley Morrison, best known for playing maid Rosario in TV comedy Will and Grace, has died aged 83.

The New Yorker played Rosario Salazar in 68 episodes of the sitcom from 1999 to 2006.

The character, an illegal immigrant from El Salvador, was only due to appear once 
but proved so popular with viewers she made regular appearances.

Debra Messing, who plays Grace Adler, led the tributes, posting on Instagram: "Oh, Shelley... what a loss."

She added: "Our dear Rosario has passed on. Shelley had a career that spanned decades, but she will always be our dear Rosie.

-The Best TV Episodes of 2019-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No one can watch all the TV shows anymore, even a professional, and that goes a thousandfold for TV episodes. So I can’t claim these to be 
definitively the best installments of TV in 2019. 

They’re just the ones that have stuck most in my mind as we head into 2020. 

(For variety’s sake, I’m skipping the many terrific episodes of the shows I already put on my 10-best list, among them “Anna Ishii-Peters” 
from “Pen15” and the mind-blowing “This Extraordinary Being” from “Watchmen.”)

First, a confession. I have not yet written about Disney Plus’s “The Mandalorian” — the biggest new TV show from the big new platform of 
the biggest media conglomerate, set within arguably America’s biggest pop mythology — because I was not able to figure out what the hell 
“The Mandalorian” is.
